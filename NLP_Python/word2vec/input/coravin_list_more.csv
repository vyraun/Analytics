The Coravinﾙ Wine System works with a specially designed argon gas capsule that is inserted into the unit cup. This allows the wine bottle to pressurize and force the wine through the needle and into your glass. 
"When you press the trigger you should hear a ﾓpsstﾔ indicating there is gas in the capsule. If you do not hear gas you may need to replace the capsule. However, you also want to check to ensure that your needle is not clogged."
"To check for a clogged needle, unscrew the needle from the Coravin System and then try a quick press of the trigger again. If you hear gas flow, then it is likely that your needle is clogged by some small cork particles. If you do NOT hear Gas with the needle removed, then you are likely out of gas and need a new Coravin Capsule."
"Place the spout of the system under a stream of warm tap water to rinse. Allow the water to drip out of the spout and needle. Once the system has been rinsed, place it upright and Quick Press the trigger twice to release some gas. This will clear any excess water in the system. Caution ﾖ never press the trigger while the spout is under the water stream."
"Coravinﾙ Capsules are designed to deliver approximately 15 5oz, (150 ml), pours per capsule. However, capsule longevity will vary a bit depending upon how you use the Coravinﾙ Wine System and how frequently you pressurize each bottle. The volume of gas into the bottle will dictate the volume of wine that pours. This volume is controlled by the person using the device. The longer you hold the trigger the more gas is used. It is more that the amount of gas used per pour will affect how many pours you get from a cartridge. If you want a smaller pour and use less gas to facilitate that pour you will get more pours per cartridge. If you want a larger pour you may receive less."
"When you access a full bottle of wine, there is a relatively small amount of airspace in the bottle.  With a half-full bottle, there is a larger amount of airspace in the bottle.  The liquid in the bottle is not compressible, so what youﾒre really doing with the Coravin is compressing the airspace that is in the bottle.  This raises the pressure inside the bottle, which then forces the wine to pour through the needle.
With a full bottle of wine, because there is a small airspace, there is only so much gas that you could put into the bottle with one press of the trigger.  You may have noticed that you need a few quick presses and releases of the trigger with a full bottle in order to get the wine to a steady flow.  With a half-full bottle, since there is more air space, you can get in more gas with each press of the trigger.  So you will need fewer presses and releases of the trigger to get the wine to a steady flow."
"On your first access it will take several short bursts of the trigger to get the wine to pour. This is because there is very little room in the bottle for the gas to go. After a couple of short bursts, hold the trigger for about 1/2 - 1 second to complete the first pour. After your first pour, you can then pour using a couple of short, (1/2-1 second) presses to obtain your pour. However, please note - it does take a bit of time; the system is designed to deliver a 4-5 ounce pour in about 20-25 seconds. You may note that if you use more bursts that wine pours a bit faster - however that generally causes a waste of the gas which you will observe through a long venting of gas into the air when the bottle is returned to the upright position after pouring. This is just gas that had no place to go in the bottle as it did not replace wine - so it empties into the air."
"If you are going to finish a bottle, we recommend you pull the cork to conserve argon gas. If you are going to pour the rest of the bottle of wine, don't pressurize with argon until the bottle is completely empty. The Coravin System is not meant to replace removing the cork entirely - if you're going to finish a bottle of wine then just pull the cork!"
"The Coravinﾙ System is designed to work exclusively with the Coravin Capsules. Alternative capsules will not work correctly, can damage the Coravin System and will void your warranty."
"The Coravinﾙ capsules are made from recyclable materials and can be recycled according to your town's regulations. 

Please note the capsules cannot be reused. Attempting to reuse the capsules can be dangerous, can damage the Coravin System and could potentially cause injury. Use of alternative capsules will void your warranty."
"The most likely reason is that when the user removes the Coravin from the bottle, the pressure may not have fully equilibrated before the cork resealed. This can leave a small amount of pressure inside the bottle ﾖ very normal, and good to have the argon pushing a little so that on the next insertion, a bit of argon pushes through the system (in case the user has not purged). Greg actually does this on purpose - 

Alternatively, the temperature of the gas going into the bottle is a bit colder than the surrounding air (pressurized gas tends to do this and the containers can feel cool to the touch). When this cool argon gas warms up a bit to the temperature of the bottle, the gas expands a bit and creates a little pressure inside the bottle. Again ﾖ very minor, very normal, and generally a good thing"
"If your Coravin is still under warranty, let us know and we will get the replacement needle out as soon as possible. Also, our engineering department would like to review the needle as we continue to learn how to make the Coravin better. If you could return the faulty needle to us it would be appreciated. We will send you a shipping label via email and you can return it in the package in which you receive the new one. Please contact us via telephone at 855-692-6728 or by email at csr@coravin.com."
"We do have replacement needles available for sale. You can place an order on line at www.coravin.com. Go to Accessories and select the needle of your choice, (the needle that came with your Coravin is the Standard needle). Or, if you would like help with your order please give us a call at 855-692-6728 and we will gladly help you to place your order.

The needle is attached with a screw-in nodule and is very easy to replace. Complete directions come with the new needle."
"These directions should help:
* Unscrew the needled grip at the top of the needle to release the needle. The needle will drop down. Tilt it slightly and gently remove it from the Coravinﾙ.
* Using your Coravin cleaning tool poke through the eye of the needle to remove any cork
* Then slide the tool into the top of the needle and slide down. This action should push any excess cork towards the opening near the needle eye.
* Poke the tool through the eye of the needle again to remove any last cork particles. Remove the clip from the needle.
* Hold the cleaned needle by the needle grip, then tilt and slide it back into the needle guide. Securely screw the needle grip back into the Coravinﾙ"
"We will be happy to send you another needled cleaning tool. 
It will come via the US Mail. We will send it out immediately."
"If you are accessing an older bottle with the Coravin System, please be careful to not agitate the bottle- use a few light presses on the trigger not the full blast so as not to agitate the sediment.

If you are especially concerned, you may carefully attach the Coravin System to the bottle when it is in nearly a horizontal state (e.g. the bottle is held in a wine basket). When the pour is completed you may raise the end of the bottle with the Coravin slowly until you hear the argon purge and then remove the Coravin. You may also want to lightly pressurize the bottle."
"The Coravin System is not intended for use on synthetic closures since they are unlikely to re-seal completely. Synthetic closures will permit some oxidation, and may result in leakage when stored or poured."
"To our knowledge, there are two types of wax closures: one that is a thin wax coating in the place of a foil capsule, and one that is a thick waxy-plastic disc that sits on top of the cork, underneath the foil capsule (most commonly found on some vintage Ports). The former, the thin wax coating, is fine for use with Coravin. The wax coating is thin and malleable enough that it will not damage the needle, or hinder your ability to access wine. The latter, however, the thick waxy disc underneath the foil can cause serious damage to the needle. They are uncommon, so it is unlikely you will run into this type of wax seal."
"* First ﾖ ensure you are accessing wines with natural cork. While you can access wines that use synthetic closures those closures do not reseal and there will be leakage.
* Sometimes, wine can pool underneath the foil and appear to be dripping or leaking - again, to determine if this is the issue, you can remove the foil to check. This happens most frequently on a first access.
* Temperature affects how a wine reseals. Corks at cooler temperatures take slightly longer to reseal.
* How long did you leave your Coravin in the cork? We do not recommend leaving the needle engaged in the cork for long periods of time, as it can make it more difficult for the cork to reseal.
* Sometimes a cork in poor condition (either due to age, manufacturing, or storage) will have difficulty resealing in general."
"Often times when a bottle is corked, there is a bit of wine at the bottle neck that pushes through the sides of the cork when the cork is inserted.  We have seen that with several of our corks during testing as well.  If the insertion of the Coravin needle was causing the cork to weaken, then the pressure in the bottle would cause the wine to ﾓcreep upﾔ along a week spot in the cork, and you would see a stain along one line, rather than all around the cork.    

Also with regard to eventual oxidation of your wine.  Our internal testing over the years did not show a discernible difference between accessed bottles and the control bottles.  Our founder Greg Lambrecht has not had this happen with any of his 10 years of development or with any of the beta testing done with Master Sommeliers or Wine Masters. There were some times when he had received feedback that they thought there was a change, however, upon conducting blind taste testing the Masters discovered that there was truly no difference from bottles that had been accessed weeks or months before and the ones that they accessed for the first time."
"Our internal testing did not show a discernible difference between accessed bottles and the control bottles.

There were some times when he had received feedback that they thought there was a change, however, upon conducting blind taste testing the Masters discovered that there was truly no difference from bottles that had been accessed weeks or months before and the ones that they accessed for the first time. These tips have helped in the few situations reported:

* Ensure your bottle has a natural cork
* Always prime the needle before inserting into the cork. After placing the Coravinﾙ on the bottle give the trigger a short press to ensure any oxygen that may be in the needle is cleared out. Then insert the needle into the cork. 
* Always remove the Coravin from the bottle in between pours. If you leave the needle in the cork for a long while it may take longer for the cork to reseal.
* After accessing the wine ensure that you store it horizontally to ensure the cork remains viable. Also, avoid temperature fluctuations that could affect the wine
* Consider conducting a blind taste test ﾖ they can be fun! We included the link to Gregﾒs video explaining the process"
"The Coravin System is actually not a preservation system; you access the wine by inserting the needle through the cork, meaning no oxygen ever enters the bottle. This way, the wine will stay fresh for months or years, rather than days or weeks."
"Each Coravin Capsule has enough argon gas to pour about 15 five ounce glasses. Thatﾒs three to four bottles, depending on usage and the size of the pour."
"After using the Coravin System, the rest of the wine will remain completely intact, as if the bottle had never been opened. However, it is important to store the bottle properly: on its side, in a cool and dark place to protect the wine from light and heat, and to keep the cork moist and in good condition."
"No, you donﾒt! The Coravin Needle will pass through foil or wax capsules without doing damage."
"The Coravin System is designed for use on bottles sealed with natural cork closures. Screw caps will not reseal, and likely damage the Coravin Needle. 

Using Coravin with a synthetic cork may permit oxidation over time, or leak. Store synthetic cork wines accessed with Coravin standing upright, and consume within 3-4 weeks of first access."
"The Coravin Needles are designed for high volume use, both at home and commercially. Therefore, you wonﾒt need to replace the needle for several hundred uses, if not more! However, should you need to replace them, it is quite easy to do. Watch the video for instructions. "
"It is very important to regularly clean your Coravin System - place the spout of the System under the faucet, and rinse with warm water. Do this each time you are finished pouring wine with Coravin."
"You will know that it is time to install a new Coravin Capsule when you press the trigger, but no wine pours out. This means that your old Capsule has run out of argon gas!"
" There are some schools that believe that it is necessary for some oxygen to be involved in the maturation of red wines ﾖ however, as a recent study has shown, ﾓwine will continue to mature and develop both with and without additional oxygen being available to the wine. However, increased availability of oxygen greatly increases the rate at which a red wine will mature, and hence shortens the drinking life of the wine.ﾔ "
"When used correctly the Coravin is designed to prevent the spread of bacteria.  The materials used to coat the needle do not harbor bacteria and fungus. In fact, all elements of the wine path leverage FDA approved food-grade materials, so there is little chance of contamination when going from bottle to bottle. 

We do recommend that if you taste something in one wine that could possibly present as taint or bacteria that you then conduct a thorough cleaning of the Coravin before accessing another bottle. We had one customer note to us that in a moment of concern they cleaned their Coravin with a potable alcohol, (i.e. vodka), and then conducted an additional cleaning with water, just to be safe. However, to reiterate, when used properly there is very little chance of bacteria transferring from bottle to bottle."

"The Coravin System accesses wine. Unlike preservation systems, which require the cork to be pulled and allow oxygen to enter the bottle, the Coravin System leaves the cork in place to continue protecting the wine."
What testing has been done to prove that the Coravin System actually works?
"Coravin believes that the best wine preservation system is the bottle and the cork. Since the Coravin System keeps the cork in place, wine continues to evolve the same way that it would in an un-accessed bottle. Some of the chemical changes that occur in wine, such as the breakdown of acids, don't require oxygen at all. Others do relate to oxygen that is naturally transmitted across the cork over time. Accessing a bottle with the Coravin System does not impact these chemical changes."
"Premium Coravin Capsules are the only capsules that can be used with the Coravin System. They are filled with the purest Argon gas available and include a proprietary cap that creates a perfect seal in the System, so that even months after initial use, no gas will escape."
Each Premium Coravin Capsule will allow you to access approximately fifteen 5 ounce glasses of wine. Capsule longevity will vary depending on how you use the Coravin System and how often and how much you pressurize each bottle.
"The Premium Coravin Capsule contains argon gas, an inert gas that does not react with wine, and has no effect on the taste profile. It is one of the seven gases that occur naturally in the air we breathe and is regularly used in the wine making process."
"The Coravin™ Model Eight Wine System is the first and only tool that lets you access, pour and enjoy wine from a bottle - without pulling the cork. By inserting the hollow needle through the cork and pressurizing the bottle with argon gas, any amount of wine can be poured. Once the desired amount is poured, the needle is removed, allowing the cork to naturally reseal itself. This keeps the wine free from oxidation and allows it to continue to age on its own. The Coravin System revolutionizes how wine is enjoyed, letting you taste any wine you want at any time."
"The Coravin™ Model Two Wine System is Coravin’s best performing system that lets you access, pour, and enjoy wine from a bottle – without pulling the cork. The bottle clamp with grips makes it effortless to attach the system to the bottle. By inserting the hollow needle through the cork and pressurizing the bottle with argon gas, any amount of wine can be poured. Once the desired amount is poured, the needle is removed, allowing the cork to naturally reseal itself. This keeps the wine free from oxidation and allows it to continue to age on its own. The Coravin Model Two combines a best-in-class wine experience with intuitive design, making it effortless to enjoy any wine, one glass at a time."
The Coravin Model Eight and Coravin 1000 System come with the same core product. The difference is that the Coravin Model Eight comes with the spray mat and the Coravin 1000 comes with the metal base.
"The Coravin Model Two and Model Eight both provide the same best-in-class experience of accessing wine. First, the two products have a different look and feel. The Model Two has “L” shaped handles with grip surfaces that make it easy to clasp and squeeze, ensuring an effortless experience of placing the system onto a bottle. The Model Eight’s clamp features the signature style one-piece paddle that is designed to hold the system onto the bottle."
The Model Two and Model Two Plus Pack come with the Standard Needle Two. This needle pours 20% faster than the Standard Needle One. The Model Eight comes with the Standard Needle One.

"Before using your Coravin System, perform a visual inspection of the wine bottle you plan to access. If you notice any signs of damage or flaws (e.g. cracked, crushed, or chipped; or containing white glass inclusions, indicating un-melted glass.), then do not use the Coravin System on that bottle.

Always be sure to use a Coravin Wine Bottle Sleeve when accessing with the Coravin System.

Before inserting the Coravin Needle into the bottle, quickly press the trigger to clear the system of any excess oxygen or wine."
"For the Model Eight System, place the gas capsule in the cup and screw it on until it gets tight, then turn the cup one extra 1/2 turn. For the Model Two, Two Plus, and Two Plus Pack Systems, place the gas capsule in the cup and screw it all the way on until there is no gap between the capsule and the system.

"
"For the Model Eight System, screw the needle into the head of the product until it is tight. For the Model Two, Two Plus, and Two Plus Pack Systems, screw the needle into the head of the product until you feel the needle ""lock"" into place, over the detent."
"In order to ensure the Faster Pour Needle Two fits into all Coravin Systems, it was necessary to make it slightly shorter than the other needles."
All Coravin Needles are interchangeable and work with every Coravin System.
Coravin capsules are designed to work in every Coravin System.
"Coravin Capsules are made of recyclable steel. Prior to recycling, please contact your local city or town waste management facility for instructions concerning the disposal of empty compressed gas cylinders. Please do not dispose of un-punctured capsules. Only puncture Coravin Capsules using the Coravin System. Do not discharge towards your face."
"The Coravin Capsules are pressurized, and should be stored between -22° and 149° F (-30° to +65° C). Coravin capsules contain gas under pressure, and may explode if heated. Store in a well-ventilated place, and out of direct sunlight."
No. It is important to only use official Coravin Capsules with your Coravin System. Coravin Capsules are especially designed to work with the Coravin System. Alternative capsules will not seal correctly and will leak. Use of non-Coravin capsules may result in injury to the user or others nearby and voids the warranty on your Coravin System.
"The bands around the grip of the Coravin Needles are color coded for easy reference:

Red — Faster Pour Needle — 16 gauge

Black — Standard Needle — 17 gauge

Silver — Vintage Cork Needle — 18 gauge"
"We recommend using the Vintage Cork Needle when you believe that your wine bottle may have an old or fragile cork. When using the Faster Pour Needle, only access bottles with very healthy corks, as the wider gauge will make it more difficult for old or fragile corks to reseal.

"
"Unscrew the needle using the needle grip, and let the needle drop down so it is resting in the needle guide. Pick it up by the needle grip and angle it to remove it from the needle guide, being careful not to scratch the side of the needle.

To insert a new needle, point the tip down through the needle guide and let it drop so that the needle grip is resting on the guide. Pick the needle up by the grip, and screw it into the unit until it is fully tightened.

Please refer to here for detailed instructions."
"After hundreds of insertions, if you notice it becoming difficult to insert or remove the needle into the cork, the coating on the needle may be worn. Inspect the tip to look for wear or damage. If the Teflon™ coating has worn off, showing a silver color rather than black, you may need a new needle. You can order replacement needles here."
"Due to the higher sugar content of dessert wines we recommend that you run through the cleaning routine twice, as described in the Product Care FAQ, to ensure that no wine remains in the system."
"If you have determined that your needle is clogged with cork particles, use the Needle Clearing Tool included with your Coravin System to unclog it.
Unscrew the needle grip at the top of the needle to release it, and let the needle drop down to rest on the needle guide. Tilt the needle slightly and gently remove it from the unit.Hold the Needle Clearing Tool by the handle and gently poke the tool through the eye of the needle to remove any cork particles. Always hold the needle by the needle grip.Insert the clearing tool into the top of the needle by the needle grip, and slide it down to push any excess cork towards the eye of the needle.Poke the tool through the eye to the needle again to remove any last cork particles.Repeat until no cork is visible through the eye.Please click here to watch our instructional video on unclogging a needle."
"We recommend storing your accessed bottles horizontally with the wine covering the cork surface inside the bottle so the cork does not dry out. For chilled wines, the cork may take longer to reseal, so keep these standing vertically until the cork has resealed."
"The Coravin System works only as well as the cork that is closing the bottle. If the cork in the bottle is of poor quality, it is likely that the cork will not effectively protect the wine. This is true regardless of whether you use the Coravin System or not.Unfortunately, the quality of cork varies, and depends on when and where it was harvested, and manufacturing techniques. Over time, corks can become brittle, dry and fragile, especially when a bottle isn’t stored properly (horizontally, with wine covering the cork to keep it from drying out)."
"Spot clean the Carry Case only, using water or a gentle detergent. Air dry. Do not submerge in liquids, machine wach, tumble dry, or bleach."
"We recommend that you keep your Coravin System in top condition with simple regular cleaning. At the end of any day you use your Coravin, a light rinse with tap water down the spout will help flush any residual wine from the system. After the rinse, press the trigger to remove any water from inside the needle. IMPORTANT: Never submerge your Coravin System in liquid and never press the trigger while rinsing the spout. For frequent users, clean the system by pouring a little white vinegar down the spout, press the trigger a few times, and then rinse with tap water. Rinsing with hot water will yield optimal results.Each time you change your Coravin Capsule it is also wise to clean the threads around the top of the black capsule cup and on the bottom of the Coravin unit where the cup attaches. This will keep the threads clean of all debris and prevent a sticky build-up that could cause difficulty in reattaching the cup. "
"Clean the system by pouring a little white vinegar down the spout, press the trigger a few times, and then rinse with tap water. Rinsing with hot water will yield optimal results. IMPORTANT: Never submerge your Coravin System in liquid and never press the trigger while rinsing the spout."
The yellow cap is used only to protect the Coravin during shipping and should be discarded. Keeping the cap on the spout could actually cause moisture to remain inside the Coravin and potentially allow bacteria to develop.
No. Do not place any part of the Coravin System in the dishwasher.

"All Coravin Wine Systems are fine for air travel without Coravin Capsules, which are prohibited due to TSA restrictions on pressurized containers. Restrictions vary by country.However, Coravin Capsules can be ordered here, for shipment directly to your destination."
"Coravin, Inc. has gone through a training process to ensure that we properly label and comply with all shipping regulations to ensure our products to be delivered safely around the world."
"Over time, if your Coravin System becomes difficult to push through the closure, the coating on the needle may be worn. Inspect the tip to look for wear or damage. If the Teflon™ coating has worn off, leaving a silver color rather than black, you may need a new needle. Replacement needles can be ordered here."
"There are several items to check if you are having trouble pouring wine. Remove the Coravin System from the bottle and give the trigger a quick press. If you hear gas escaping, then you have gas and the needle is clear — the problem is likely that the Coravin System was not fully seated on the bottle and the needle had not penetrated the closure.If you do NOT hear gas escaping after a quick press of the trigger, you may simply be out of gas, or your needle may be clogged with some cork particles. To check for a clogged needle, unscrew the needle from the Coravin System and then try a quick press of the trigger again. If you hear gas flow, then it is likely that your needle is clogged by some small cork particles. Please refer to Clearing a Clogged Needle or click here to watch our instructional video.If you do NOT hear gas with the needle removed, then you are likely out of gas and need a new Coravin Capsule.If none of these remedies work, please contact Customer Service at csr@coravin.com or 1 855 692 6728 for assistance."
"Make sure that the bottle is tilted so that the spout is lower than the bottle's base, and that the needle tip in the bottle is always submerged in wine. If the needle tip is not submerged, a mix of argon and wine will flow out of the bottle causing excessive foam. For the optimal pour, pour along the inside edge of the glass, as this reduces splash and bubbles in the wine."
"When you are done pouring and tilt the bottle back upright, the inside of the bottle goes from high to low pressure which can create a cloud that will quickly dissipate. This is normal and does not affect the remaining wine."
"1. A loose needle could cause some leaking or dripping while pouring. Please ensure that the needle is tightly attached to the Coravin unit. You can check this by turning the needle grip counter-clockwise until there is no more give to the turn. 2. If you have previously accessed the bottle the most likely reason that a cork will leak is that you have used the Coravin System with a synthetic closure. Although this will not damage the Coravin Needle, and will still allow you to pour wine, the cork will not reseal, and oxidation will occur over time. If you have accessed a bottle with a synthetic closure, store it upright.3. If you are accessing a bottle with a natural cork that is below room temperature or chilled, the cork will take a bit longer to reseal. This does not mean that oxygen is entering the bottle during the resealing process, the argon in the bottle is still protecting your wine.4. It is possible that a small amount of residual wine in the Coravin Needle pooled in between the cork and the foil upon removal of the Coravin System from the bottle. This excess wine can sometimes leak from underneath the foil even though the cork has fully resealed.5. If you access a bottle with a natural cork in poor condition, it is possible that it will not reseal fully and leak."
"Please ensure that you are tightening the black cup as quickly and firmly onto the unit as it can be, so that it is fully tightened. If the cup is not twisted on tightly enough, it may not seal fully, allowing argon gas to escape from the Coravin System.

The Coravinﾙ Wine System works with a specially designed argon gas capsule that is inserted into the unit cup. This allows the wine bottle to pressurize and force the wine through the needle and into your glass. 
"When you press the trigger you should hear a ﾓpsstﾔ indicating there is gas in the capsule. If you do not hear gas you may need to replace the capsule. However, you also want to check to ensure that your needle is not clogged."
"To check for a clogged needle, unscrew the needle from the Coravin System and then try a quick press of the trigger again. If you hear gas flow, then it is likely that your needle is clogged by some small cork particles. If you do NOT hear Gas with the needle removed, then you are likely out of gas and need a new Coravin Capsule."
"Place the spout of the system under a stream of warm tap water to rinse. Allow the water to drip out of the spout and needle. Once the system has been rinsed, place it upright and Quick Press the trigger twice to release some gas. This will clear any excess water in the system. Caution ﾖ never press the trigger while the spout is under the water stream."
"Coravinﾙ Capsules are designed to deliver approximately 15 5oz, (150 ml), pours per capsule. However, capsule longevity will vary a bit depending upon how you use the Coravinﾙ Wine System and how frequently you pressurize each bottle. The volume of gas into the bottle will dictate the volume of wine that pours. This volume is controlled by the person using the device. The longer you hold the trigger the more gas is used. It is more that the amount of gas used per pour will affect how many pours you get from a cartridge. If you want a smaller pour and use less gas to facilitate that pour you will get more pours per cartridge. If you want a larger pour you may receive less."
"When you access a full bottle of wine, there is a relatively small amount of airspace in the bottle.  With a half-full bottle, there is a larger amount of airspace in the bottle.  The liquid in the bottle is not compressible, so what youﾒre really doing with the Coravin is compressing the airspace that is in the bottle.  This raises the pressure inside the bottle, which then forces the wine to pour through the needle.
With a full bottle of wine, because there is a small airspace, there is only so much gas that you could put into the bottle with one press of the trigger.  You may have noticed that you need a few quick presses and releases of the trigger with a full bottle in order to get the wine to a steady flow.  With a half-full bottle, since there is more air space, you can get in more gas with each press of the trigger.  So you will need fewer presses and releases of the trigger to get the wine to a steady flow."
"On your first access it will take several short bursts of the trigger to get the wine to pour. This is because there is very little room in the bottle for the gas to go. After a couple of short bursts, hold the trigger for about 1/2 - 1 second to complete the first pour. After your first pour, you can then pour using a couple of short, (1/2-1 second) presses to obtain your pour. However, please note - it does take a bit of time; the system is designed to deliver a 4-5 ounce pour in about 20-25 seconds. You may note that if you use more bursts that wine pours a bit faster - however that generally causes a waste of the gas which you will observe through a long venting of gas into the air when the bottle is returned to the upright position after pouring. This is just gas that had no place to go in the bottle as it did not replace wine - so it empties into the air."
"If you are going to finish a bottle, we recommend you pull the cork to conserve argon gas. If you are going to pour the rest of the bottle of wine, don't pressurize with argon until the bottle is completely empty. The Coravin System is not meant to replace removing the cork entirely - if you're going to finish a bottle of wine then just pull the cork!"
"The Coravinﾙ System is designed to work exclusively with the Coravin Capsules. Alternative capsules will not work correctly, can damage the Coravin System and will void your warranty."
"The Coravinﾙ capsules are made from recyclable materials and can be recycled according to your town's regulations. Please note the capsules cannot be reused. Attempting to reuse the capsules can be dangerous, can damage the Coravin System and could potentially cause injury. Use of alternative capsules will void your warranty."
"The most likely reason is that when the user removes the Coravin from the bottle, the pressure may not have fully equilibrated before the cork resealed. This can leave a small amount of pressure inside the bottle ﾖ very normal, and good to have the argon pushing a little so that on the next insertion, a bit of argon pushes through the system (in case the user has not purged). Greg actually does this on purpose – Alternatively, the temperature of the gas going into the bottle is a bit colder than the surrounding air (pressurized gas tends to do this and the containers can feel cool to the touch). When this cool argon gas warms up a bit to the temperature of the bottle, the gas expands a bit and creates a little pressure inside the bottle. Again ﾖ very minor, very normal, and generally a good thing"
"If your Coravin is still under warranty, let us know and we will get the replacement needle out as soon as possible. Also, our engineering department would like to review the needle as we continue to learn how to make the Coravin better. If you could return the faulty needle to us it would be appreciated. We will send you a shipping label via email and you can return it in the package in which you receive the new one. Please contact us via telephone at 855-692-6728 or by email at csr@coravin.com."
"We do have replacement needles available for sale. You can place an order on line at www.coravin.com. Go to Accessories and select the needle of your choice, (the needle that came with your Coravin is the Standard needle). Or, if you would like help with your order please give us a call at 855-692-6728 and we will gladly help you to place your order.The needle is attached with a screw-in nodule and is very easy to replace. Complete directions come with the new needle."
"These directions should help:
* Unscrew the needled grip at the top of the needle to release the needle. The needle will drop down. Tilt it slightly and gently remove it from the Coravinﾙ.
* Using your Coravin cleaning tool poke through the eye of the needle to remove any cork
* Then slide the tool into the top of the needle and slide down. This action should push any excess cork towards the opening near the needle eye.
* Poke the tool through the eye of the needle again to remove any last cork particles. Remove the clip from the needle.
* Hold the cleaned needle by the needle grip, then tilt and slide it back into the needle guide. Securely screw the needle grip back into the Coravinﾙ"
"We will be happy to send you another needled cleaning tool. 
It will come via the US Mail. We will send it out immediately."
"If you are accessing an older bottle with the Coravin System, please be careful to not agitate the bottle- use a few light presses on the trigger not the full blast so as not to agitate the sediment.If you are especially concerned, you may carefully attach the Coravin System to the bottle when it is in nearly a horizontal state (e.g. the bottle is held in a wine basket). When the pour is completed you may raise the end of the bottle with the Coravin slowly until you hear the argon purge and then remove the Coravin. You may also want to lightly pressurize the bottle."
"The Coravin System is not intended for use on synthetic closures since they are unlikely to re-seal completely. Synthetic closures will permit some oxidation, and may result in leakage when stored or poured."
"To our knowledge, there are two types of wax closures: one that is a thin wax coating in the place of a foil capsule, and one that is a thick waxy-plastic disc that sits on top of the cork, underneath the foil capsule (most commonly found on some vintage Ports). The former, the thin wax coating, is fine for use with Coravin. The wax coating is thin and malleable enough that it will not damage the needle, or hinder your ability to access wine. The latter, however, the thick waxy disc underneath the foil can cause serious damage to the needle. They are uncommon, so it is unlikely you will run into this type of wax seal."
"* First ﾖ ensure you are accessing wines with natural cork. While you can access wines that use synthetic closures those closures do not reseal and there will be leakage.
* Sometimes, wine can pool underneath the foil and appear to be dripping or leaking - again, to determine if this is the issue, you can remove the foil to check. This happens most frequently on a first access.
* Temperature affects how a wine reseals. Corks at cooler temperatures take slightly longer to reseal.
* How long did you leave your Coravin in the cork? We do not recommend leaving the needle engaged in the cork for long periods of time, as it can make it more difficult for the cork to reseal.
* Sometimes a cork in poor condition (either due to age, manufacturing, or storage) will have difficulty resealing in general."
"Often times when a bottle is corked, there is a bit of wine at the bottle neck that pushes through the sides of the cork when the cork is inserted.  We have seen that with several of our corks during testing as well.  If the insertion of the Coravin needle was causing the cork to weaken, then the pressure in the bottle would cause the wine to ﾓcreep upﾔ along a week spot in the cork, and you would see a stain along one line, rather than all around the cork.    Also with regard to eventual oxidation of your wine.  Our internal testing over the years did not show a discernible difference between accessed bottles and the control bottles.  Our founder Greg Lambrecht has not had this happen with any of his 10 years of development or with any of the beta testing done with Master Sommeliers or Wine Masters. There were some times when he had received feedback that they thought there was a change, however, upon conducting blind taste testing the Masters discovered that there was truly no difference from bottles that had been accessed weeks or months before and the ones that they accessed for the first time."

There were some times when he had received feedback that they thought there was a change, however, upon conducting blind taste testing the Masters discovered that there was truly no difference from bottles that had been accessed weeks or months before and the ones that they accessed for the first time. These tips have helped in the few situations reported:
* Ensure your bottle has a natural cork
* Always prime the needle before inserting into the cork. After placing the Coravinﾙ on the bottle give the trigger a short press to ensure any oxygen that may be in the needle is cleared out. Then insert the needle into the cork. 
* Always remove the Coravin from the bottle in between pours. If you leave the needle in the cork for a long while it may take longer for the cork to reseal.
* After accessing the wine ensure that you store it horizontally to ensure the cork remains viable. Also, avoid temperature fluctuations that could affect the wine
* Consider conducting a blind taste test ﾖ they can be fun! We included the link to Gregﾒs video explaining the process"
"The Coravin System is actually not a preservation system; you access the wine by inserting the needle through the cork, meaning no oxygen ever enters the bottle. This way, the wine will stay fresh for months or years, rather than days or weeks."
"Each Coravin Capsule has enough argon gas to pour about 15 five ounce glasses. Thatﾒs three to four bottles, depending on usage and the size of the pour."
"After using the Coravin System, the rest of the wine will remain completely intact, as if the bottle had never been opened. However, it is important to store the bottle properly: on its side, in a cool and dark place to protect the wine from light and heat, and to keep the cork moist and in good condition."
"No, you donﾒt! The Coravin Needle will pass through foil or wax capsules without doing damage."
"The Coravin System is designed for use on bottles sealed with natural cork closures. Screw caps will not reseal, and likely damage the Coravin Needle.
Using Coravin with a synthetic cork may permit oxidation over time, or leak. Store synthetic cork wines accessed with Coravin standing upright, and consume within 3-4 weeks of first access."
"The Coravin Needles are designed for high volume use, both at home and commercially. Therefore, you wonﾒt need to replace the needle for several hundred uses, if not more! However, should you need to replace them, it is quite easy to do. Watch the video for instructions. "
"It is very important to regularly clean your Coravin System - place the spout of the System under the faucet, and rinse with warm water. Do this each time you are finished pouring wine with Coravin."
"You will know that it is time to install a new Coravin Capsule when you press the trigger, but no wine pours out. This means that your old Capsule has run out of argon gas!"
" There are some schools that believe that it is necessary for some oxygen to be involved in the maturation of red wines ﾖ however, as a recent study has shown, ﾓwine will continue to mature and develop both with and without additional oxygen being available to the wine. However, increased availability of oxygen greatly increases the rate at which a red wine will mature, and hence shortens the drinking life of the wine.ﾔ "
"When used correctly the Coravin is designed to prevent the spread of bacteria.  The materials used to coat the needle do not harbor bacteria and fungus. In fact, all elements of the wine path leverage FDA approved food-grade materials, so there is little chance of contamination when going from bottle to bottle. 
We do recommend that if you taste something in one wine that could possibly present as taint or bacteria that you then conduct a thorough cleaning of the Coravin before accessing another bottle. We had one customer note to us that in a moment of concern they cleaned their Coravin with a potable alcohol, (i.e. vodka), and then conducted an additional cleaning with water, just to be safe. However, to reiterate, when used properly there is very little chance of bacteria transferring from bottle to bottle."
